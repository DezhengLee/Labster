# Labster
这是一个对中国的大学物理实验（尤其是DUTers）进行数据处理的小东西. 
This is a little program that to deal with data anaylsis in college Physics in China (especially for DUTers in Panjin campus).
Currently, this program is based on pylatex to generate a LaTeX report and sympy to do symbolic calculation. 
The template .csv can be used to generate a report and you can check if the rounding method is used in your university.
This is just a product of a whim of a Math student so don't execpt too much ~ 
And there may be some bugs when the data are all in type of int, I'm now trying to fix these bugs.
In the near future I hope I can add an image recognition module in the project to actualize the automatic handwritting-data reading function, if, of course, I have enough time and fully understand group theory.
